# Jackson Pfeffer's Automation for VATSIM
## How to install/use?
See the [wiki](https://github.com/CrazyKidJack/VATSIM/wiki)

## Info
* Currently only the Alias2Facility program is implemented.
* The "ImportAliases2Facility" project is empty. When building the solution from scratch, that project raises errors that should be ignored.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/CrazyKidJack/VATSIM/wiki) for documentation and the [releases page](https://github.com/CrazyKidJack/VATSIM/releases) for downloads and release notes!
